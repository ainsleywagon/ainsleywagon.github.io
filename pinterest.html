        <p>Pinterest is a great source for finding new things based on curating the things you like, and they're using
          all kinds of signals to learn what you might like. But sometimes they get it wrong!</p>

      <p class="project-text">My task was to design a way for Pinners to tell us "I want to keep getting
        recipe suggestions, but I just don't eat meat." or "I do like fashion,
        but I'd <i>never</i> wear this dress."

      <p class="project-text">To make the patterns I either start from a sketch that
        I digitize or begin straight in Illustrator. I typically go through several
        iterations of each idea before I hit on something I really like.

        <br>
        Recently I have started exploring <a href="http://printallover.me/collections/freshwash">applying these patterns to textiles</a>. Iâ€™m
        really excited to see how they transition from the digital world to the physical.

        I like to give myself a place to do something I love doing without a deadline
        but with an outlet. I like to make them quickly most of the time, to generate
        graphics, try things, move on, try other things. Sometimes I let myself obsess
        over the details and make something really intricate. That feels good too.
        <br>

        Having this side project sharpens my visual design skills, serves as a way
        for me to process all the visuals I'm absorbing as I go through my day, keeps
        me looking for patterns out in the world that I want to riff on, and has made
        me extremely good at the pattern-making tool in Illustrator.
