        <p>Personal taste is complicated. Pinterest is a great source for finding
          new things that are in line with your taste by learning from the signals
          of what you like. But sometimes they get it wrong!</p>

    <div class="row col-md-12">
      <p class="project-text">My task was to design a way for Pinners to tell us "I want to keep getting
        recipe suggestions, but I just don't eat meat." or "I do like fashion,
        but I'd <i>never</i> wear this dress."
        <br>
        <br>
        So I started by designing systems where users could pinpoint the exact thing about a Pin
        they didn't like, and letting them tell us how to recommend better pins. For me, this lent itself
        to tappable bubbles - almost like popping the bubbles that didn't represent you.

      <img src="images/Pinterest/explorations-2.png" style="max-width:700px; float:left;">
      <p class="project-text">But this kind of feedback was so specific, that we had to
        build a bridge from the current way of interacting to a future and ideal one. This meant
        baking it into the contextual menu, where users have previously found editing functionality.

        <br>
        Then the task was having the ideal in mind while still designing for the current
        look and feel of the app. We were testing an assumption and mapping out a
        possible future.
