        <p>Call & Response is an interactive installation that translates
          audio into living visual responses.</p>

        Call & Response was born from a shared love of translating audio into
         visual interactions. This project was created in partnership with
         Andrew Allred and Chris Wininger, and debuted earlier this year
        at the <a href="http://www.lexingtonartleague.org/">Lexington Art League</a>
        as a part of the Expanding Fields Exhibition.

        We were most interested in bringing this work to life and testing our theories
        of interaction by having it in a public space. We found that people were
        curious and willing to interact, particularly by clapping or snapping into
        the microphone but shy about talking or singing.

        I designed the behavior and look and feel of the installation, and relied
        totally on Chris and Andrew for the engineering talent to parse audio data
        into the visual signals that resulted. Read Chris' write-up about the engineering side

        The debut was a success and lot of fun. We got to see people interacting with
        our work and learn about behaviors in the gallery setting.
