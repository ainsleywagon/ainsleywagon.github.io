        Call & Response was born from a shared love of translating audio into
         visual interactions. This project was created in partnership with
         Andrew Allred and Chris Wininger, and debuted earlier this year
        at the <a href="http://www.lexingtonartleague.org/">Lexington Art League</a>
        as a part of the Expanding Fields Exhibition.

        We were most interested in bringing this work to life and testing our theories
        of interaction by having it in a public space. We found that people were
        curious and willing to interact, particularly by clapping or snapping into
        the microphone but shy about talking or singing.

        I designed the behavior and look and feel of the installation, and Chris
        and Andrew wrote the javascript to parse audio input and script the behavior
        into the resulting interactions. Read Chris' write-up

        The debut was a success and lot of fun. We got to see people interacting with
        our work and learn about behaviors in the gallery setting.
