        <p>Call & Response is an interactive installation that translates audio
          input from gallery participants into projected visuals.</p>

        Call & Response was born from a shared love of music and technology between myself,
         Andrew Allred and Chris Wininger. We debuted this project earlier this year
        at the <a href="http://www.lexingtonartleague.org/" target="_blank">Lexington Art League</a>
        as a part of the <strong>Expanding Fields Exhibition.</strong>

        For this installation, a microphone is placed in front of a projection
        onto a blank white wall. The microphone detects ambient sounds and visuals,
        while showing a prompt that invites the participant to make more intentional
        sounds into the microphone. Once a sound is made into the mic, that sound is processed
        into a visual thatâ€™s projected onto the screen. As the sounds change, the
        visuals change in response.

        For example, when the microphone detects talking, the default white bubbles begin
        to grow. As the microphone
        detects tonal sounds, like melodic speaking or singing, the bubbles begin to
        change into vibrant colors. As any of these sounds are sustained, the bubbles
        continue to grow, encouraging more interaction. Finally, snapping and clapping sounds
        change the color scheme completely. Read Chris' excellent write-up on the technical
        side <a href="https://www.wegotrats.com/call-and-response/" target="_blank">here</a>.

        We wanted to use the gallery space to not only invite people to explore the
        relationship between seen and heard but to challenge the assumption that
        galleries are for observation only. Instead, we proposed that the gallery
        is a space to explore, make noise, to project your own interpretations
        straight onto the blank wall.

        We were thrilled to see this project come to life at Lexington Art League, and
        to observe how it was used by gallery-goers. Originally we had
        intended for it to coax people into singing, but we found that people were most comfortable
        clapping and snapping into the microphone, and that the resulting color scheme change was
        the most satisfying interaction. We look forward to iterating on this project and
        making it even more immersive!
