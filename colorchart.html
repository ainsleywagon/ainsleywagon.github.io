        <h1>Color Chart</h1>
        <h4 class="project-descr-subheader"><a href="http://ainsleywagon.github.io/color-chart/">CSS Color Chart</a> is an outpouring of my passion for CSS Colors.</h4>
          <p>I had used namespace colors in CSS in a limited way but had never
            investigated the comprehensive list until I came across this very
            colorful project and its designer told me he used only namespace values for the colors.</p>

      <p class="project-text">When looking for charts that had the comprehensive list,
        I was disappointed in how they were displayed. They weren't a
        good visual of what the colors would look like when applied and I had
        trouble telling one shade from another. So that was enough of an excuse
        to make my own and put them in rainbow order.
        <br>
        <br>
        I loved organizing the colors into categories and then painstakingly
        trying different color orders. I don't always get time to
        obsess over the details and just revel in colors, so this was like a guilty pleasure.

        <p class="project-text">
        For this project I used Github pages to host a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript site.
        Imanol Aranzadi partnered with me to help with the Angular.js and make the values
        copy-able to the clipboard.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoyed making this chart so much that I wanted to learn more about how they were
        named. I gave a talk at CSS Conf Oakland about what I found.
