        <p>While in residency for Code for America in San Juan, Puerto Rico, I had
        the privilege to meet and talk to a lot of Puerto Rican citizens about the
        challenges facing the island. Outside of our project's focus area, one major
        concern was the large amounts of Puerto Ricans leaving the island - particularly
        young people.</p>

      <p class="project-text">With <a href="ilovepuertorico.org">ILovePuertoRico.org</a>, we wanted to build a platform
        that collected all the little reasons why its citizens loved the island. We
        wanted a visual wall of love notes detailing why people stayed in Puerto Rico.
        People loved the premise and the messages we collected were amazing. From
        family to its natural beauty, to the work ethic of the people - the sentiments
        we uncovered were a powerful testament to the spirit of the island.
        <br>
        <br>
        I worked with my developer teammate to spin up this platform, which has since
        been forked for many other feel-good purposes (birthday greetings are a
        particularly popular use.) This was my first stab at reading and writing in Jade,
        and I had a lot of fun building something that was an easy and straightforward
        way for people to communicate positive feelings about their country.
