      <b>Digital Product Designer in San Francisco</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm a designer / musician / maker / writer interested in creating immersive atmospheres.
      I was raised by church musicians and schooled by architecture academics.
      <br>
      <br>
      I got my degree in Architecture where I designed
      hospitals, built light fixtures, played with Arduinos, and give a lecture about haptic installations.
      I gravitated to digital products for the potential of rapid iteration
      and the very intimate way in which we connect to our devices.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last year I contracted with Pinterest, Yo, and IDEO.org.
      <br>
      I am currently an Experience Designer with Adobe XD.
