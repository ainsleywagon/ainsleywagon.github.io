      <b>Digital Product Designer in San Francisco</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm a designer / musician / writer interested in the intersection of music and visuals.
      <br>
      <br>
      I studied Architecture and gravitated to digital products for the
      potential of rapid iteration and a reverence for the interfaces that
      humanize technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      I am currently an Experience Designer at Adobe.
