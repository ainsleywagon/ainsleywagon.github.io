    <p class="job-title">Digital Product Designer in San Francisco</p>
    <p class="inner about-text">
      I'm a designer / musician / artist interested in the intersection of music and visuals.
      <br>
      <br>
      I studied Architecture and gravitated to digital products for the
      potential of rapid iteration and my reverence for interfaces that
      humanize technology.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm currently designing at Adobe.
