      <b>Digital Product Designer in San Francisco.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I have always loved
      color and visual balance. As a kid, I
      obsessed over the perfect pairing of pink & green and arranged M&Ms
      in rainbow order. Since first meeting Adobe Illustrator in 2008,
      Iâ€™ve been making graphics and figuring out how to put them in front of people.        <br>
      <br>
      I got my undergraduate degree in Architecture and had the chance to explore product
      design, play with arduinos, and give a lecture about haptic installations.
      I wanted to design brighter, iterate faster, and have more control over
      the final product so I gravitated to digital products for the web.
      <br>
      <br>
      I love shaping the visual direction of the design as well as being involved
      in the details of its implementation.
      Recently I have contracted with IDEO.org, Yo, and Camperoo.
      I am currently designing on the Product Design Team at Pinterest.

      I totally read my emails.
