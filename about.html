      <b>Digital Product Designer in San Francisco</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Raised by church musicians and schooled by architecture professors.
      I'm a designer / musician / maker / writer interested in creating immersive atmospheres.
      <br>
      <br>
      I got my degree in Architecture where I built light fixtures, played with
      Arduinos, and gave lectures about haptic installations by day while I made
      music and art with friends by night.
      <br>
      I gravitated to digital products for the potential of rapid iteration
      and a reverence for the very intimate way we connect to our devices.
      <br>
      <br>
      Last year I contracted with Pinterest, Yo, and IDEO.org.
      <br>
      I am currently an Experience Designer with Adobe XD.
