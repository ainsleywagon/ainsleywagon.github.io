        <h4 class="project-descr-subheader">PrimerPeso is an application that helps small businesses connect with government incentives.</h4>
        <p>PrimerPeso is an application I designed and developed with two teammates during my
          Code for America Fellowship year. We worked in partnership with the
          government of Puerto Rico to research how we could
          use technology to improve economic development.</p>
        <p>This project presented distinct challenges- both from
          working in a Spanish-speaking country as well as promoting great
          design in the civic and governmental space.</p>

      <p class="project-text">From many hours of user interviews of government employees and community
        members in Puerto Rico, we realized that the government had many
        incentives available to foster small businesses, but most business owners didnâ€™t know about them.
        We wanted our application to bridge this knowledge gap.
        <br>
        <br>
        In developing PrimerPeso we conducted over
        80 hours of user interviews in Puerto Rico and spent several weeks
        combing this research and defining our user and MVP.
