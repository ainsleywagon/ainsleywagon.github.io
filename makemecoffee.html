        <p>This is a project I co-developed with <a href="https://twitter.com/iaranzadi">Imanol Aranzadi</a>
        after trying to explain a coffee routine involving
        very precise measurements.</p>

      <p class="project-text">We wanted to find a way to pre-program the ratios
        for coffee grounds and water so that you could choose your brew method,
        say how much coffee you wanted, and then get the correct measurements of
        each ingredient.

        It's important to me to do one thing and do it well, so we wanted to nail
        this calculator part before adding any other functionality. There is an
        info screen that has a little bit of information around brew methods, but
        besides that the app is really simple and straightforward.
        We have plans to submit it to the app store, so look for it soon!
