        <p>This is a project I co-developed with <a href="https://twitter.com/iaranzadi">Imanol Aranzadi</a>
        after trying to explain an elaborate coffee routine.</p>

      <p class="project-text">We wanted to find a way to pre-program the ratios
        for coffee grounds and water so that you could choose your brew method,
        say how much coffee you wanted, and then get the correct measurements of
        each ingredient.

        We kept it simple. You tell the app how much coffee you want to make, and it
        tells you how much coffee you need to grind and how much water to add.
