      <p class="project-text">One of my projects at Adobe has been to redesign the share
        pages for when someone sends an asset (file, folder, or library) to someone else,
        and wants them to be able to browse and view it publicly.
        <br>
        <br>
        This meant a deep dive into how best to display assets, in a way that
        would showcase the content but be browsable for quick access.
        <br>
        <br>
        I developed a language that kept consistency with existing workflows but allowed
        more room for the content to shine, while still building in ways to sort, filter, and
        navigate.
