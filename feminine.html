        <h1>Feminine Economy Exchange</h1>
        <h4 class="project-descr-subheader">How do we build new systems rooted in feminine values?</h4>
        <p>
          Inspired by Jennifer Armbrust's <a href="http://feminineeconomy.com/">Proposals for the Feminine Economy</a>, I wanted to know what a system
          rooted in feminine values might look like.
        </p>

        <p class="project-text">
        I wanted to see if it was possible to build new systems to replace the old.
        I tried this experiment in April 2017 and 18 people participated.
        We practiced a new way of being together and exchanging
        what we have in abundance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then - I wrote about it! The Feminine Economy Exchange Guide is a summary and toolkit so
        you can replicate your own feminine economy and build new systems wherever you are.
