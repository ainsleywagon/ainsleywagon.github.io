      <p class="inner about-text">I have always loved
        color and balancing things visually. As a kid, I
        obsessed over the perfect pairing of pink & green and arranged M&Ms
        in rainbow order. Since first meeting Adobe Illustrator in 2008,
        Iâ€™ve been making vector graphics and figuring out how to put them on the internet.        <br>
        <br>
        I got my undergrad degree in Architecture and had the chance to explore product
        design, play with arduinos, and give a lecture about haptic installations.
        I wanted to design brighter, iterate faster, and have more control over
        the final product so I gravitated toward designing digital products on the web.
        <br>
        <br>
        With particular experience working on small teams, I love shaping the
        visual direction of the design as well as the details of its implementation.
        Last year I was a Code for America fellow working with Puerto
        Rico and spent my year designing an application that (beautifully)
        matches small business owners with available government incentives.
        I am currently the Product Designer at Yo.

        I totally read my emails.
