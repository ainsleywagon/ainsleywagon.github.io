      <p>Working with <a href="http://cirrusmio.com/">CirrusMio</a>, I learned my
        first lessons about scoping a product.
        We formed as a start-up to build a social networking platform
        for non-profits, volunteers, and donors. We built and launched and
        things did not go like we had hoped.

    <h2 class="pull-quote">Building grassroots products</h2>
    <p class="project-text">We decided to we would focus on building products
      that addressed the donor-volunteer-nonprofit ecosystem one piece at a time,
      and to work with organizations in our community of Lexington, Kentucky.
      With this shift, we started building things we believed in and could see
      the immediate impact of. The difference was huge.

      <br>
      Among nonprofits, a large source of donations comes from workplace giving
      campaigns. The leading platform for workplace giving campaigns is currently
      United Way. But United Way does not facilitate donations to every
      501(c)(3) organization, and this excludes a lot of nonprofits, particularly
      grassroots organizations.

    <p class="project-text">CivChoice facilitates workplace-giving campaigns to
      any IRS-registered not-for-profit organization. It does this by using a
      digital currency in exchange for any dollar amount that is then redistributed
      to the non-profit of the userâ€™s choice.
      <br>
      <br>
      I developed the branding and identity of CivChoice in order to communicate
      its goals of inclusive giving, trustworthiness, and accessibility. I also
      worked on the user interaction flows and user experience so that employers
      and individual employees could intuitively navigate the system.

      This was my first project working with a front-end team, and my teammates
      at CirrusMio were incredible mentors as I worked with Ruby code and wrote CSS.
      I created the user interface art assets and worked on the implementation
      of the design in the code.
