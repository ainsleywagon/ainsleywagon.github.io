      <h1>What is a Feminine Economy?</h4>
      <p class="project-text">
        This April in San Francisco, I ran an art project that prototyped a
        feminine economy.
        <br>
        <br>
        Inspired by Jennifer Armbrust's <a href="http://feminineeconomy.com/">Proposals for the Feminine Economy</a>, I wanted to know what a system
        rooted in feminine values might look like.

        I wanted to see if it was possible to build new systems to replace the old.
        <br>
        <br>
        18 people participated and we practiced a new ways of being together and exchanging
        what we have in abundance.
